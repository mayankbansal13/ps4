    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
    
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating smart machines 
    capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, 
    reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
    
    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience 
    without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms build mathematical models based on training data 
    to make predictions or decisions.
    
    Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple 
    layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has been particularly 
    successful in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
    
    Key applications of AI include:
    - Computer vision and image recognition
    - Natural language processing and chatbots  
    - Autonomous vehicles and robotics
    - Medical diagnosis and drug discovery
    - Financial trading and fraud detection
